This project is designed to investigate how and why population range shifts occur, specifically focusing on Fish Crows (Corvus ossifragus) in the Northeastern United States. I compare Fish Crow range and migration patterns to American Crows (a close relative and potential competitor), Ring-Billed Gulls (a strongly habitat-constrained species), American Robins (a migratory species), and Mourning Doves (a non-migratory species). 

Bird population data comes from eBird, a citizen science database with billions of observations from around the world. Scripts 02-05 convert the data into a format more useful for estimating observation frequency (by zerofilling) and reduce some of the spatial bias inherent in the data by filtering and subsampling.

The exploratory data analysis (EDA) scripts (06-1 to 07) provide several ways to visualize the resulting data. The goal of this work is to provide insight and intuition into how distributions of the 5 focal species change within a year and how they have changed over time.
